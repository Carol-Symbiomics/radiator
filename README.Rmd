# radiator: an R package for RADseq Data Exploration, Manipulation and Visualization

This is the development page of the **radiator**, 
if you want to help, see [contributions section](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator#contributions)

Most genomic analysis look for patterns and trends with various statistics. 
Bias, noise and outliers can have bounded influence on estimators and interfere
with polymorphism discovery. Avoid bad data exploration and control the impact
of filters on your downstream genetic analysis. Use radiator to: import, explore,
manipulate, visualize, filter, impute and export your GBS/RADseq data.

## Installation
To try out the dev version of **radiator**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/radiator")
library(radiator)
```

## Learning radiator

See if radiator as the right tools for you:

**1. Prepare a strata file**

* It's a tab separated file, e.g. `radiator.strata.tsv`.
* A minimum of 2 columns: `INDIVIDUALS` and `STRATA` is required. 
* The `STRATA` column identifies the individuals stratification, 
the hierarchical groupings: populations, sampling sites or any grouping you want.
* It's like *stacks* population map file with header...

To make sure it's going to work properly, try reading it in `R` with:
```r
strata <- radiator::read_strata("my.strata.tsv")
names(strata)
# more details in with `??radiator::read_strata`
```

**2. Filter your RADseq data: ONE FUNCTION TO RULE THEM ALL**

```r
data <- radiator::filter_rad(data = "my.vcf", strata = "my.strata.tsv", output = c("genind", "hierfstat"))
```

* There's a built-in interactive mode that requires users to visualize the data before choosing thresholds.
* The function is made of modules (see below) that user's can access separately or in combination. 
* Use [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org) `%>%` to chain filtering
functions together and dig deeper into your data [see vignettes](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator#vignettes-r-notebooks-and-examples)
* But remember, for 95% of users, `filter_rad` will be enough to start exploring the biology!

## Life cycle

**Missing data**

Visualizing missing data and it's imputations requires special attention that fall 
outside the scope of *radiator*. 
Inside my package called [grur](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur), users
can **visualize patterns of missingness** associated with different variables 
(lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, homozygosity, etc).
Several **Map-independent imputations** of missing genotypes are available:
**Random Forests** (on-the-fly-imputations or predictive modeling), 
**Extreme Gradient Tree Boosting**, 
Strawman imputations (~ max/mean/mode: the most frequently observed, non-missing genotypes is used).
Imputations can be conducted **overall samples** or **by populations/strata/grouping**.
`radiator::genomic_converter` is integrated with the imputation function of **grur**.


## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
* **Parallel computing**: follow the steps in this [notebook vignette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5npumwdo0cxtxi4/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0) to install the packages with OpenMP-enabled compiler and conduct imputations in parallel.
* [Installation problems.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5npumwdo0cxtxi4/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0)
* **Windows users**: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
* The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)), so I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for a better experience.
* Running codes in chunks inside R Notebook might cause problem, run it outside in the console.

## Vignettes, R Notebooks and examples

**Vignettes (in development, check periodically for updates):**

* Vignettes with real data for example in the form of R Notebooks take too much
space to be included in package, without CRAN complaining.
Consequently, vignettes are gradually being excluded from the package and
distributed separately, follow the links below.
* **installation problems** [notebook vignette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5npumwdo0cxtxi4/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0)
* **parallel computing during imputations** [notebook vignette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5npumwdo0cxtxi4/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0)

## radiator workflow 
The **radiator** package fits currently at the end of the GBS workflow (e.g. after running [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) inside R with [stackr](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr).

**Step 1 Quality** Ask yourself these questions: 

* Quality of : DNA, libraries and sequencing lanes ? 
* Please, stop thinking in terms of quantity (e.g. millions of reads returned),
and prioritize and think more about the actual quality of your new data.
* Read about the quality metrics used in available software (e.g. fastqc)

**Step 2 *de novo* assembly and genotyping** 

* This part is conducted outside radiator (e.g. using [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) inside R with the package [stackr](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr))
* Software pipelines include: [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/), [pyRAD](http://dereneaton.com/software/), [dDocent](https://ddocent.wordpress.com), [AftrRAD](http://u.osu.edu/sovic.1/downloads/). If you want to develop your own pipeline, 
there are a multitude of approaches, good luck.
* At the end of the pipeline, use liberal filter thresholds the go in radiator and
do the heavy lifting.

**Step 3 Pattern of missingness**

* `grur::missing_visualization`: I really like running this function after modifying my RAD data,
to make sure bias were not introduce.
* The trick here is to use the `strata` argument to find patterns associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, etc).
* Do you see a trend between your missing pattern and reads/samples ? Heterozygosity?
* Do you need more sequencing? Do you have to re-run some lanes? 
* Usually for this first run I only use the blacklists of ID and markers to start filtering with individuals and markers that won't drag down the polymorphism discovery. I re-introduce individuals at the end of the pipeline and re-run `grur::missing_visualization` to see what the new analysis reveal.

**Step 4 Outliers**

* Remove replicates (I hope you have some).
* Remove *de novo* assembly artifact: 
* run `stackr::summary_haplotypes` to automatically
generate blacklist of genotypes and whitelist of markers.
The function will highlight individuals and locus with more than 2 alleles 
(outlier individuals and markers).
* run `filter_snp_number`, function will highlight outlier locus/reads
with extreme number of SNP/read or haplotypes 
* Remove potential duplicated samples that went off your radar with `detect_duplicate_genomes`.
* Remove mixed samples or pooled samples that creates
outliers individual's heterozygosity with the function `detect_mixed_individuals`.

**Step 5 Pattern of missingness**

* Re-run `grur::missing_visualization` with/without your new blacklists (e.g. of genotypes, individuals) and with/without whitelist of markers to examine patterns of missingness in you dataset before more extensive filtering (there is a vignette for this step)
* The trick here is to use the `strata` argument to find patterns associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, etc).
* Do you see a trend between your missing pattern and reads/samples ? Heterozygosity?

**Step 6: Metrics and statistics, some thoughts**
* Metrics: what you're observing so far is it *de novo* artefact or 
a reliable signal of biological polymorphism?
* Statistics: are you going to use haplotype or snp level statistics?
Should the statistic you are interested in be consistent throughout the read ?
* Use `snp.ld` argument in several of radiator functions to throughly test
the consistensies of SNPs statistics among haplotype.

**Step 7 Coverage and Genotype Likelihood**

* Coverage is an individual metric. With most software you'll find allele and genotype coverage info.
* Genotype likelihood is usually a metric based on coverage of the different genotypes found in all of your data. Since it's v.1.45, STACKS no longer output the useful GL metric inside the VCF.
It was using only one number to qualify the genotype, while most other pipelline using GL/PL are 
using 3 numbers for homozygous REF, heterozygous and homozygous ALT genotypes.
* Good allele coverage is required for reliable genotypes.
* Reliable genotypes is required for reliable downstream summary statistics.
* If your data allows it (you have coverage and/or genotype likelihood metrics),
explore filtering options in `filter_coverage` and `filter_genotype_likelihood`.

**Step 8 Prop. Genotyped**

* Use the functions `filter_individual` and `filter_population` to explore
if you have enough individuals and enough putative populations for markers filtering.
* Use blacklist of individuals with different thresholds.
* Keep different whitelist of markers.
* Use `common.markers` argument inside most of radiator functions to test the impact of vetting loci based on shared markers. This can be use strategically for Fst calculations.
* Use imputation methods provided by radiator (inside `tidy_genomic_data` or `genomic_converter`, as a separate module: `radiator_imputations_module`) to assess the impact of lowering or increasing threshold that impact missing data.

**Step 9 HET, Fis, HWE**

* Overall and/or per populations hwe, heterozygosity and Fis statistics can highlight: 
*de novo* assembly problems (oversplitting/undermerging), genotyping problems or
biological problems.
* These filters allows to test rapidly if departure from realistic expectations
are a problem for downstream analysis ?
* Choose your threshold wisely and test impact on pipeline.
* Use `filter_het`, `filter_fis`, `filter_hwe` and look again 
at the individual's heterozygosity (`detect_mixed_individuals`) for outliers.
* Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: this analysis as [several underlying assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy–Weinberg_principle). 
Please do not conduct analysis with sampling sites. Note: most natural
populations are violating one or more of the assumptions.

**Step 10 MAF**

* Remove artifactual and uninformative markers.
* Use MAF arguments inside several of radiator functions to tailor MAF to your analysis tolerance to minor allelel frequencies.
* There is also a separate filter in radiator: `filter_maf`
* I usually run the filter to explore and understand the impact of the different
thresholds on the data. Then use different ones inside the different functions of
radiator.

**Step 11 Pattern of missingness, yes... again!**

* Use `grur::missing_visualization` with your latest blacklists (e.g. of genotypes, individuals) and with your latest whitelist of markers to examine patterns of missingness in your dataset after filtering.
* Hopefully, you will have remove all the bias with the filters.
