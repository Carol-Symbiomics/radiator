# radiator: an R package for RADseq Data Exploration, Manipulation and Visualization

This is the development page of the **radiator**, 
if you want to help, see [contributions section](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator#contributions)

Most genomic analysis look for patterns and trends with various statistics. 
Bias, noise and outliers can have bounded influence on estimators and interfere
with polymorphism discovery. Avoid bad data exploration and control the impact
of filters on your downstream genetic analysis. Use radiator to: import, explore,
manipulate, visualize, filter, impute and export your GBS/RADseq data.

**radiator** is designed and optimized for fast computations using Genomic Data Structure [GDS](http://zhengxwen.github.io/gdsfmt) file format and data science packages in 
[tiverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). **radiator** handles VCF files with millions of
SNPs and files of several GB.

## Installation
To try out the dev version of **radiator**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/radiator")
library(radiator)
```

## Learning radiator

See if radiator as the right tools for you:

**1. Prepare a strata file**

* It's a tab separated file, e.g. `radiator.strata.tsv`.
* A minimum of 2 columns: `INDIVIDUALS` and `STRATA` is required. 
* The `STRATA` column identifies the individuals stratification, 
the hierarchical groupings: populations, sampling sites or any grouping you want.
* It's like *stacks* population map file with header...

To make sure it's going to work properly, try reading it in `R` with:
```r
strata <- radiator::read_strata("my.strata.tsv")
names(strata)
# more details in with `??radiator::read_strata`
```

**2. Filter your RADseq data: ONE FUNCTION TO RULE THEM ALL**

```r
data <- radiator::filter_rad(data = "my.vcf", strata = "my.strata.tsv", output = c("genind", "hierfstat"))
```

* There's a built-in interactive mode that requires users to visualize the data before choosing thresholds.
* The function is made of modules (see below) that user's can access separately or in combination. 
* Use [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org) `%>%` to chain filtering
functions together and dig deeper into your data [see vignettes](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator#vignettes-r-notebooks-and-examples)
* But remember, for 95% of users, `filter_rad` will be enough to start exploring the biology!

## Life cycle

**DArT users**: 

* `filter_dart`: is now deprecated. Please use `filter_rad`.
* `tidy_dart` and `tidy_silico_dart`: are now deprecated. 
Please use `read_dart` for all the 4 DArT files recognized by radiator.

**Missing data: visualization and imputations**

Visualizing missing data and it's imputations requires special attention that fall 
outside the scope of **radiator**. 
Inside my package called [grur](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur), users
can **visualize patterns of missingness** associated with different variables 
(lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, homozygosity, etc).
Several **Map-independent imputations** of missing genotypes are available:
**Random Forests** (on-the-fly-imputations or predictive modeling), 
**Extreme Gradient Tree Boosting**, 
Strawman imputations (~ max/mean/mode: the most frequently observed, non-missing genotypes is used).
Imputations can be conducted **overall samples** or **by populations/strata/grouping**.
`radiator::genomic_converter` is integrated with the imputation function of **grur**.


## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
* **Parallel computing**: follow the steps in this [notebook vignette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5npumwdo0cxtxi4/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0) to install the packages with OpenMP-enabled compiler and conduct imputations in parallel.
* [Installation problems.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5npumwdo0cxtxi4/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0)
* **Windows users**: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
* The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)), so I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for a better experience.
* Using my R Notebook: use the option to [run chunks of codes in console, not inline](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html#fig:notebook-console).

## Vignettes, R Notebooks and examples

**Vignettes (in development, check periodically for updates):**

* Vignettes with real data for example in the form of R Notebooks take too much
space to be included in package, without CRAN complaining.
Consequently, vignettes are gradually being excluded from the package and
distributed separately, follow the links below.
* **installation problems** [notebook vignette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1kz59xpolb5y52m/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0)
* **parallel computing during imputations** [notebook vignette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1kz59xpolb5y52m/rad_genomics_computer_setup.nb.html?dl=0)
