  This package has been developed in the open, and it wouldn’t be nearly as good without your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help me make this package even better:
  
  * If you don’t understand something, please let me know. 
* Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable. 
* If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull request.

New to pull request on github ? The process is very easy:
  
  * Click the edit this page on the sidebar.
* Make the changes using github’s in-page editor and save.
* Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes.

## Issues

I cannot help you if I cannot reproduce the problem, consequently when reporting an issue, make sure to include:

* the exact command (function, arguments, values) used
* the complete error message you're getting
* the output of `devtools::session_info()`
* complete data required to reproduce the problem, a subset of it. The data remains confidential.
