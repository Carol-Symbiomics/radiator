# radiator v.0.0.6 2017-10-02

* `tidy_genomic_data` and `genomic_converter`: bug fix and improvements.
* `write_snprelate` and it's associated output from `genomic_converter` is no longer
available because of difficulties students are having in installing the package,
it's dependencies and/or using the output. The code remains available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7xujizkvpi0ddac/write_snprelate.R?dl=0),
without support.


# radiator v.0.0.5 2017-09-20

* `tidy_dart` and `filter_dart`: 
    * big overhaul.
    * importing 1 and 2 row genotypes (called sometimes binary format) is easier
    and no longer require to prep the DArT file
    (the function parse DArT data with `*` at the beginning of certain lines).
    * filtering is easier and now interactive for those who want.
    * plots are generated automatically. 
* `tidy_genomic_data` and `genomic_converter` can now accept DArT data directly.
* several typos where fix. Thanks to @IdoBar for this.
