\title{Read and tidy \href{http://www.diversityarrays.com}{DArT} output files.}
\usage{
read_dart(data, strata, filename = NULL, tidy.dart = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE, parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{One of the DArT output files. 6 formats used by DArT are recognized
by radiator.
recognised:
\enumerate{
\item \code{1row}: Genotypes are in 1 row and coded (0, 1, 2, -).
\code{0 for 2 reference alleles REF/REF}, \code{1 for 2 alternate alleles ALT/ALT},
\code{2 for heterozygote REF/ALT}, \code{- for missing}.
\item \code{2rows}: No genotypes. It's absence/presence, 0/1, of the REF and ALT alleles.
Sometimes called binary format.
\item \code{counts}: No genotypes, It's counts/read depth for the REF and ALT alleles.
Sometimes just called count data.
\item \code{silico.dart}: SilicoDArT data. No genotypes, no REF or ALT alleles.
It's a file coded as absence/presence, 0/1, for the presence of sequence in
the clone id.
\item \code{silico.dart.counts}: SilicoDArT data. No genotypes, no REF or ALT alleles.
It's a file coded as absence/presence, with counts for the presence of sequence in
the clone id.
\item \code{dart.vcf}: For DArT VCFs, please use \code{\link{read_vcf}}.
}

Depending on the number of markers, these format will be recoded similarly to
VCF files (dosage of alternate allele, see details).

The function can import \code{.csv} or \code{.tsv} files.


If you encounter a problem, sent me your data so that I can update
the function.}

\item{strata}{A tab delimited file or object with 3 columns.
Columns header is:
\code{TARGET_ID}, \code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}.
Note: the column \code{STRATA} refers to any grouping of individuals.
You need to make sure that
the column \code{TARGET_ID} match the id used by DArT. With the \code{counts}
format the \code{TARGET_ID} is a series of integer.
With \code{1row} and \code{2rows} the \code{TARGET_ID} is actually the sample
name submitted to DArT.
The column \code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA} will be kept in the tidy data.
Only individuals in the strata file are kept in the tidy, i.e. that the strata
is also used as a whitelist of individuals/strata.
Silico DArT data is currently used to detect sex markers, so the \code{STRATA}
column should be filed with sex information: \code{M} or \code{F}.

See example on how to extract the TARGET_ID of your DArT file.

\href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/utq2h6o00v55kep/example.dart.strata.tsv?dl=0)}{example.dart.strata.tsv}.}

\item{filename}{(optional) The function uses \code{\link[fst]{write.fst}},
to write the tidy data frame in
the working directory. The file extension appended to
the \code{filename} provided is \code{.rad}.
With default: \code{filename = NULL}, the tidy data frame is
in the global environment only (i.e. not written in the working directory...).}

\item{tidy.dart}{(logical, optional) Generate a tidy dataset.
Default:\code{tidy.dart = FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{(optional, logical) When \code{verbose = TRUE}
the function is a little more chatty during execution.
Default: \code{verbose = TRUE}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core used for parallel
execution during import.
Default: \code{parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}

\item{...}{(optional) To pass further argument for fine-tuning the function.}
}
\value{
A radiator GDS file and tidy dataframe with several columns depending on DArT file:
\code{silico.dart:} A tibble with 5 columns: \code{CLONE_ID, SEQUENCE, VALUE, INDIVIDUALS, STRATA}.
This object is also saved in the directory (file ending with .rad).

Common to \code{1row, 2rows and counts}: A GDS file is automatically generated.
To have a tidy tibble, the argument \code{tidy.dart = TRUE} must be used.

\enumerate{
\item VARIANT_ID: generated by radiator and correspond the markers in integer.
\item MARKERS: generated by radiator and correspond to CHROM + LOCUS + POS separated by 2 underscores.
\item CHROM: the chromosome info, for de novo: CHROM_1.
\item LOCUS: the locus info.
\item POS: the SNP id on the LOCUS.
\item COL: the position of the SNP on the short read.
\item REF: the reference allele.
\item ALT: the alternate allele.
\item INDIVIDUALS: the sample name.
\item STRATA/POP_ID: populations id of the sample.
\item GT_BIN: the genotype based on the number of alternate allele in the genotype
(the count/dosage of the alternate allele). \code{0, 1, 2, NA}.
\item REP_AVG: the reproducibility average, output specific of DArT.
}
Other columns potentially in the tidy tibble:
\enumerate{
\item GT: the genotype in 6 digit format \emph{Ã  la genepop}.
\item GT_VCF: the genotype in VCF format \code{0/0, 0/1, 1/1, ./.}.
\item GT_VCF_NUC: the genotype in VCF format, but keeping the nucleotide information.
\code{A/A, A/T, T/T, ./.}
\item AVG_COUNT_REF: the coverage for the reference allele, output specific of DArT.
\item AVG_COUNT_SNP: the coverage for the alternate allele, output specific of DArT.
\item READ_DEPTH: the number of reads used for the genotype (count data).
\item ALLELE_REF_DEPTH: the number of reads of the reference allele (count data).
\item ALLELE_ALT_DEPTH: the number of reads of the alternate allele (count data).
}


Written in the working directory:
\itemize{
\item The radiator GDS file
\item The DArT metadata information
\item The tidy DArT data
\item The strata file associated with this tidy dataset
\item The allele dictionary is a tibble with columns:
\code{MARKERS, CHROM, LOCUS, POS, REF, ALT}.
}
}
\description{
Used internally in \href{https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator}{radiator}
and might be of interest for users. The function generate a GDS object/file
and optionally, a tidy dataset using
\href{http://www.diversityarrays.com}{DArT} files.
}
\section{Advance mode}{


\emph{dots-dots-dots ...} allows to pass several arguments for fine-tuning the function:
\enumerate{
\item \code{whitelist.markers}: detailed in \code{\link[radiator]{filter_whitelist}}.
Defautl: \code{whitelist.markers = NULL}.
\item \code{missing.memory} (option, path)
This argument allows to erase genotypes that have bad statistics.
It's the path to a file \code{.rad} file that contains 3 columns:
\code{MARKERS, INDIVIDUALS, ERASE}. The file is produced by several radiator
functions. For DArT data, \code{\link[radiator]{filter_rad}} generate the file.
Defautl: \code{missing.memory = NULL}. Currently not used.
\item \code{path.folder}: (optional, path) To write output in a specific folder.
Default: \code{path.folder = NULL}. The working directory is used.
\item \code{pop.levels}: detailed in \code{\link[radiator]{tidy_genomic_data}}.
