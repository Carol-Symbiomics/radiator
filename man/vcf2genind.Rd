\arguments{
\item{data}{12 options: VCF (SNPs or Haplotypes,
to make the vcf population ready, see details below),
plink, stacks haplotype file, genind (library(adegenet)),
genlight (library(adegenet)), gtypes (library(strataG)), genepop, DArT,
and a data frame in long/tidy or wide format.
\emph{See details} of \code{\link[radiator]{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{output}{19 genomic data formats can be exported: tidy (by default),
genind, genlight, vcf (for file format version, see details below), plink, genepop,
structure, arlequin, hierfstat, gtypes (strataG), bayescan, betadiv, pcadapt,
hzar, snprelate (for SNPRelate's GDS, see details).
Use a character string,
e.g. \code{output = c("genind", "genepop", "structure")}, to have preferred
output formats generated. The tidy format is generated automatically.
Default: \code{output = NULL}.}

\item{filename}{(optional) The filename prefix for the object in the global environment
or the working directory. Default: \code{filename = NULL}. A default name will be used,
customized with the output file(s) selected.}

\item{blacklist.id}{(optional) A blacklist with individual ID and
a column header 'INDIVIDUALS'. The blacklist is an object in your
global environment or a file in the working directory
(e.g. "blacklist.txt"). \code{_} and \code{:} in individual's names
are changed to a dash \code{-}.
Default: \code{blacklist.id = NULL}.}

\item{blacklist.genotype}{(optional) Useful to erase genotype with below
average quality, e.g. genotype with more than 2 alleles in diploid likely
sequencing errors or genotypes with poor genotype likelihood or coverage.
The blacklist has a minimum of 2 column headers (markers and individuals).
Markers can be 1 column (CHROM or LOCUS or POS),
a combination of 2 (e.g. CHROM and POS or CHROM and LOCUS or LOCUS and POS) or
all 3 (CHROM, LOCUS, POS). The markers columns must be designated: CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or POS (integer). The id column designated
INDIVIDUALS (character) columns header.
The blacklist is an object in your global environment or
a file in the working directory (e.g. "blacklist.genotype.txt").
For de novo VCF, CHROM column
with 'un' need to be changed to 1.
Marker names are cleaned of
separators that interfere with some packages or codes:
\code{/}, \code{:}, \code{-} and \code{.} are changed to an underscore
\code{_}.
Ids are also cleaned of separators that interfere with some packages or codes:
\code{_} and \code{:} are changed to a dash \code{-}.
Default: \code{blacklist.genotype = NULL} for no blacklist of
genotypes to erase.}

\item{whitelist.markers}{(optional) A whitelist containing CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or
POS (integer) columns header. To filter by chromosome and/or locus and/or by snp.
The whitelist is an object in your
global environment or a file in the working directory (e.g. "whitelist.txt").
Note that \emph{de novo} CHROM column with 'un' need to be changed to 1.
In the VCF, the column ID is the LOCUS identification (VCF generated from
stacks have the SNP position on the read embedded in the ID,
so the ID = no longer represent the LOCUS). Marker names are cleaned of
separators that interfere with some packages or codes:
\code{/}, \code{:}, \code{-} and \code{.} are changed to an underscore
\code{_}.
Default \code{whitelist.markers = NULL} for no whitelist of markers.}

\item{monomorphic.out}{(optional) Should the monomorphic
markers present in the dataset be filtered out ?
Default: \code{monomorphic.out = TRUE}.}

\item{snp.ld}{(optional) \strong{For data with locus and SNP info, like VCF and DArT file}.
SNP short distance linkage disequilibrium pruning. With anonymous markers from
RADseq/GBS de novo discovery, you can minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD) by
choosing among these 4 options:
\code{snp.ld = "random"} for a random selection of 1 SNP on the read,
\code{snp.ld = "first"} for the first one on the read...,
\code{snp.ld = "last"} for the last SNP on the read and
\code{snp.ld = "middle"} for locus with > 2 SNPs/read the option to select at random
one SNP between the first and the last SNP on the read. If the locus as <= 2
SNPs on the read, the first one is selected. Note that for that last option,
the numbers are reported. For long distance linkage
disequilibrium pruning, see details below.
Default: \code{snp.ld = NULL}.}

\item{common.markers}{(optional) Logical. Default: \code{common.markers = TRUE},
will only keep markers in common (genotyped) between all the populations.}

\item{maf.thresholds}{(optional) Default: \code{maf.thresholds = NULL}. For no
MAF filtering.

String with 5 values
(e.g. \code{maf.thresholds = c("maf approach", local maf, "OR", global maf, number pop threshold)},
\code{maf.thresholds = c("SNP", 0.001, "OR", 0.001, 1)}):
\enumerate{
\item maf approach (character: "SNP"/"locus"):
MAF filtering is conducted by SNPs or locus.
\code{"SNP"}: will consider all the SNPs on the same locus/read as independent.
\code{"locus"}: looks at the minimum MAF found on the
read/locus. Using this option will discard all the markers/snp on
that read based on the thresholds chosen. For the locus approach to work, your dataset
requires SNP and Locus info (e.g. from a VCF file).

\item local maf (double): The maf threshold at the population level.
Not sure about the threshold to use, choose the interactive mode argument.

\item maf operator (character: "OR" / "AND"):
When filtering over LOCUS or SNP, 2 options available to consider the local/global MAF:
The local \code{"AND"} the global MAF. The local \code{"OR"}
global MAF.

\item global maf (double): The maf threshold taken at the dataset level.
Not sure about the threshold to use, choose the interactive mode argument.

\item maf pop num threshold (integer)
The number of pop required to pass the thresholds
to keep the marker. Usually, I always use \code{1}, for 1 pop is required to
pass thresholds and keep the marker.
}}

\item{max.marker}{(integer, optional) For large PLINK files,
useful to subsample marker number. e.g. if the data set
contains 200 000 markers and \code{max.marker = 10000}, 10000 markers are
subsampled randomly from the 200000 markers. If you need specific markers,
use \code{whitelist.markers} argument.
Default: \code{max.marker = NULL}.}

\item{strata}{(optional)
The strata file is a tab delimited file with a minimum of 2 columns headers:
\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}.
If a \code{strata} file is specified with all file formats that don't
require it, the strata argument will have precedence on the population
groupings used internally in those file formats. For file formats without
population/strata groupings (e.g. vcf, haplotype files) if no strata file is
provided, 1 pop/strata grouping will automatically be created.
For vcf and haplotypes file, the strata can also be used as a whitelist of id.
Samples not in the strata file will be discarded from the data set.
The \code{STRATA} column can be any hierarchical grouping.
To create a strata file see \code{\link[radiator]{individuals2strata}}.
If you have already run
\href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/}{stacks} on your data,
the strata file is similar to a stacks \emph{population map file},
make sure you
have the required column names (\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}).
The strata column is cleaned of a white spaces that interfere with some
packages or codes: space is changed to an underscore \code{_}.
Default: \code{strata = NULL}.}

\item{pop.levels}{(optional, string) This refers to the levels in a factor. In this
case, the id of the pop.
Use this argument to have the pop ordered your way instead of the default
alphabetical or numerical order. e.g. \code{pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")}
instead of the default \code{pop.levels = c("ALB", "ONT", "QUE")}.
White spaces in population names are replaced by underscore.
Default: \code{pop.levels = NULL}.}

\item{pop.labels}{(optional, string) Use this argument to rename/relabel
your pop or combine your pop. e.g. To combine \code{"QUE"} and \code{"ONT"}
into a new pop called \code{"NEW"}:
(1) First, define the levels for your pop with \code{pop.levels} argument:
\code{pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")}.
(2) then, use \code{pop.labels} argument:
\code{pop.labels = c("NEW", "NEW", "ALB")}.
To rename \code{"QUE"} to \code{"TAS"}:
\code{pop.labels = c("TAS", "ONT", "ALB")}.
Default: \code{pop.labels = NULL}. If you find this too complicated,
there is also the \code{strata} argument that can do the same thing,
see below.
White spaces in population names are replaced by underscore.}

\item{pop.select}{(string, optional) Selected list of populations for
the analysis. e.g. \code{pop.select = c("QUE", "ONT")} to select \code{QUE}
and \code{ONT} population samples (out of 20 pops).
Default: \code{pop.select = NULL}}

\item{imputation.method}{(character, optional)
Methods available for map-independent imputations of missing genotype
(see details for more info):

\enumerate{
\item \code{imputation.method = "max"} Strawman imputation,
the most frequently observed genotypes (ties are broken at random).

\item \code{imputation.method = "rf"} On-the-fly-imputations using
Random Forests algorithm.

\item \code{imputation.method = "rf_pred"} Random Forests algorithm is used
as a prediction problem.

\item \code{imputation.method = "boost"} extreme gradient boosting trees.

\item \code{imputation.method = "mca"} Multiple Correspondence Analysis (in devel).

\code{imputation.method = NULL} the function will stop.
Default: \code{imputation.method = NULL}.
}}

\item{hierarchical.levels}{(character, optional) \code{c("global", "strata")}.
Should the imputations be computed by markers globally or by strata.
Historically, this was \code{"populations"}.

Note that imputing genotype globally in conjunction with
\code{imputation.method = "max"} can potentially create huge bias.
e.g. by introducing foreign genotypes/haplotypes in some populations
(see note for more info).
Default: \code{hierarchical.levels = "strata"}.}

\item{num.tree}{(integer, optional) The number of trees to grow
when \code{imputation.method = "rf"} or \code{imputation.method = "rf_pred"}.
Default: \code{num.tree = 50}.}

\item{pred.mean.matching}{(integer, optional) Used in conjunction with
random Forests (\code{imputation.method = "rf_pred"}).
Number of candidate non-missing
value to sample from during the predictive mean matching step.
A fast k-nearest neighbor searching algorithms is used with this approach.
\code{pred.mean.matching = 3} will use 3 neighbors.
Default: \code{pred.mean.matching = 0}, avoids this step.}

\item{random.seed}{(integer, optional) For reproducibility, set an integer
that will be used to initialize the random generator. With default,
a random number is generated.
Default: \code{random.seed = NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{(optional, logical) When \code{verbose = TRUE}
the function is a little more chatty during execution.
Default: \code{verbose = TRUE}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core used for parallel
execution during vcf import.
Default: \code{parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}
