\title{Write a \href{https://github.com/bcm-uga/pcadapt}{pcadapt}
file from a tidy data frame}
\usage{
write_pcadapt(data, pop.select = NULL, snp.ld = NULL,
  maf.thresholds = NULL, filename = NULL,
  parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame object in the global environment or
a tidy data frame in wide or long format in the working directory.
\emph{How to get a tidy data frame ?}
Look into \pkg{radiator} \code{\link{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{pop.select}{(string, optional) Selected list of populations for
the analysis. e.g. \code{pop.select = c("QUE", "ONT")} to select \code{QUE}
and \code{ONT} population samples (out of 20 pops).
Default: \code{pop.select = NULL}}

\item{snp.ld}{(optional) \strong{For data with locus and SNP info, like VCF and DArT file}.
SNP short distance linkage disequilibrium pruning. With anonymous markers from
RADseq/GBS de novo discovery, you can minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD) by
choosing among these 4 options:
\code{snp.ld = "random"} for a random selection of 1 SNP on the read,
\code{snp.ld = "first"} for the first one on the read...,
\code{snp.ld = "last"} for the last SNP on the read and
\code{snp.ld = "middle"} for locus with > 2 SNPs/read the option to select at random
one SNP between the first and the last SNP on the read. If the locus as <= 2
SNPs on the read, the first one is selected. Note that for that last option,
the numbers are reported. For long distance linkage
disequilibrium pruning, see details below.
Default: \code{snp.ld = NULL}.}

\item{maf.thresholds}{(optional) Default: \code{maf.thresholds = NULL}. For no
MAF filtering.

String with 5 values
(e.g. \code{maf.thresholds = c("maf approach", local maf, "OR", global maf, number pop threshold)},
\code{maf.thresholds = c("SNP", 0.001, "OR", 0.001, 1)}):
\enumerate{
\item maf approach (character: "SNP"/"locus"):
MAF filtering is conducted by SNPs or locus.
\code{"SNP"}: will consider all the SNPs on the same locus/read as independent.
\code{"locus"}: looks at the minimum MAF found on the
read/locus. Using this option will discard all the markers/snp on
that read based on the thresholds chosen. For the locus approach to work, your dataset
requires SNP and Locus info (e.g. from a VCF file).

\item local maf (double): The maf threshold at the population level.
Not sure about the threshold to use, choose the interactive mode argument.

\item maf operator (character: "OR" / "AND"):
When filtering over LOCUS or SNP, 2 options available to consider the local/global MAF:
The local \code{"AND"} the global MAF. The local \code{"OR"}
global MAF.

\item global maf (double): The maf threshold taken at the dataset level.
Not sure about the threshold to use, choose the interactive mode argument.

\item maf pop num threshold (integer)
The number of pop required to pass the thresholds
to keep the marker. Usually, I always use \code{1}, for 1 pop is required to
pass thresholds and keep the marker.
}}

\item{filename}{(optional) The file name prefix for the pcadapt file
written to the working directory. With default: \code{filename = NULL},
the date and time is appended to \code{radiator_pcadapt_}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core used for parallel
execution during vcf import.
Default: \code{parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}
}
\value{
A pcadapt file is written in the working directory a genotype matrix
object is also generated in the global environment.

\description{
Write a
\href{https://github.com/bcm-uga/pcadapt}{pcadapt}
file from a tidy data frame. The data is biallelic.
Used internally in
\href{https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator}{radiator}
and might be of interest for users.

Also integrated in this function:
\enumerate{
\item \emph{pop.select: } to choose population to include in the pcadapt file.
\item \emph{maf: } evaluate the impact of Minor Allele Frequency on
genome scans with radiator maf module related arguments.
\item \emph{snp.ld: } SNPs on the same locus should not be considered
independant (short linkage disequilibrium) and the snp.ld argument
integrated here give users the ability to adress this quickly before
running a genome scan.
\item by defaults only markers found in common between populations are used
\item by defaults monomorphic markers are automatically removed before
generating the pcadapt file.
}
}
\details{
\emph{Integrated filters:} Only markers found in common between
populations are used and monomorphic markers are automatically removed
before generating pcadapt file.
