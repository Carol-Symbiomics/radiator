\title{Write a fineRADstructure file from a tidy data frame}
\usage{
write_fineradstructure(data, strata = NULL, filename = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame object in the global environment or
a tidy data frame in wide or long format in the working directory.
\emph{How to get a tidy data frame ?}
Look into \pkg{radiator} \code{\link{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{strata}{(path or object) The strata file or object.
Additional documentation is available in \code{\link{read_strata}}.
Use that function to whitelist/blacklist populations/individuals.
Option to set \code{pop.levels/pop.labels} is also available.}

\item{filename}{(optional) The file name prefix for the fineRADstructure file
written to the working directory. With default: \code{filename = NULL},
the date and time is appended to \code{radiator_fineradstructure_}.}
}
\value{
A fineRADstructure file is written in the working directory.
An object is also returned in the global environment.

\description{
Write a \href{https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure}{fineRADstructure}
file from a tidy data frame.
Used internally in \href{https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator}{radiator}
and might be of interest for users.
}
\details{
fineRADstructure requires special formating for populations,
it needs to be ONLY LETTERS, not numbers. This information is then merged
with the sample id (converted to integers). radiator will generate a
dictionary file.
}
\section{Life cycle}{


It become increasingly difficult for me to follow all the different naming
schemes researcher uses, if they're is any strategy... Consequently, I have
abandoned the idea of formating with letters the populations
to generate the fineRADstrucure file. If you get an error see the
the details section.
