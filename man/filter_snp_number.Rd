\arguments{
\item{data}{12 options: VCF (SNPs or Haplotypes,
to make the vcf population ready, see details below),
plink, stacks haplotype file, genind (library(adegenet)),
genlight (library(adegenet)), gtypes (library(strataG)), genepop, DArT,
and a data frame in long/tidy or wide format.
\emph{See details} of \code{\link[radiator]{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{vcf.metadata}{(optional, logical or string) For VCF files only.
With \code{logical, TRUE/FALSE}, \code{vcf.metadata = FALSE}, only the genotype
information is kept (GT field). With \code{vcf.metadata = TRUE},
all the metadata contained in the \code{FORMAT} field will be kept in
the tidy data file. radiator is currently keeping/cleaning only these metadata:
\code{"DP", "AD", "GL", "PL", "GQ", "GOF", "NR", "NV"}.
If you need different one, submit a request.
With \code{string}, explicitely ask for a particular FORMAT field you want
to keep (except the GT field that is always imported).
e.g. \code{vcf.metadata = "PL"} or \code{vcf.metadata = c("DP", "GL")}.
Default: \code{vcf.metadata = FALSE}.}

\item{interactive.filter}{(optional, logical) Do you want the filtering session to
be interactive. With default: \code{interactive.filter == TRUE}, the user is
asked to see figures of distribution before making filtering decisions.}

\item{max.snp.number}{(integer) This is best decide after viewing the figures.
If the argument is set to 2, locus with 3 and more SNPs will be blacklisted.}

\item{filename}{(optional) Name of the filtered tidy data frame file
written to the working directory (ending with \code{.tsv})
Default: \code{filename = NULL}.}

\item{blacklist.id}{(optional) A blacklist with individual ID and
a column header 'INDIVIDUALS'. The blacklist is an object in your
global environment or a file in the working directory
(e.g. "blacklist.txt").
Default: \code{blacklist.id = NULL}.}

\item{blacklist.genotype}{(optional) Useful to erase genotype with below
average quality, e.g. genotype with more than 2 alleles in diploid likely
sequencing errors or genotypes with poor genotype likelihood or coverage.
The blacklist has a minimum of 2 column headers (markers and individuals).
Markers can be 1 column (CHROM or LOCUS or POS),
a combination of 2 (e.g. CHROM and POS or CHROM and LOCUS or LOCUS and POS) or
all 3 (CHROM, LOCUS, POS). The markers columns must be designated: CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or POS (integer). The id column designated
INDIVIDUALS (character) columns header.
The blacklist is an object in your global environment or
a file in the working directory (e.g. "blacklist.genotype.txt").
For de novo VCF, CHROM column
with 'un' need to be changed to 1.
Marker names are cleaned of
separators that interfere with some packages or codes:
\code{/}, \code{:}, \code{-} and \code{.} are changed to an underscore
\code{_}.
Ids are also cleaned of separators that interfere with some packages or codes:
\code{_} and \code{:} are changed to a dash \code{-}.
Default: \code{blacklist.genotype = NULL} for no blacklist of
genotypes to erase.}

\item{whitelist.markers}{(optional) A whitelist containing CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or
POS (integer) columns header. To filter by chromosome and/or locus and/or by snp.
The whitelist is an object in your
global environment or a file in the working directory (e.g. "whitelist.txt").
Note that \emph{de novo} CHROM column with 'un' need to be changed to 1.
In the VCF, the column ID is the LOCUS identification (VCF generated from
stacks have the SNP position on the read embedded in the ID,
so the ID = no longer represent the LOCUS). Marker names are cleaned of
separators that interfere with some packages or codes:
\code{/}, \code{:}, \code{-} and \code{.} are changed to an underscore
\code{_}.
Default \code{whitelist.markers = NULL} for no whitelist of markers.}

\item{monomorphic.out}{(optional) Should the monomorphic
markers present in the dataset be filtered out ?
Default: \code{monomorphic.out = TRUE}.}

\item{max.marker}{(integer, optional) For large PLINK files,
useful to subsample marker number. e.g. if the data set
contains 200 000 markers and \code{max.marker = 10000}, 10000 markers are
subsampled randomly from the 200000 markers. If you need specific markers,
use \code{whitelist.markers} argument.
Default: \code{max.marker = NULL}.}

\item{snp.ld}{(optional) \strong{For data with locus and SNP info, like VCF and DArT file}.
SNP short distance linkage disequilibrium pruning. With anonymous markers from
RADseq/GBS de novo discovery, you can minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD) by
choosing among these 4 options:
\code{snp.ld = "random"} for a random selection of 1 SNP on the read,
\code{snp.ld = "first"} for the first one on the read...,
\code{snp.ld = "last"} for the last SNP on the read and
\code{snp.ld = "middle"} for locus with > 2 SNPs/read the option to select at random
one SNP between the first and the last SNP on the read. If the locus as <= 2
SNPs on the read, the first one is selected. Note that for that last option,
the numbers are reported. For long distance linkage
disequilibrium pruning, see details below.
Default: \code{snp.ld = NULL}.}

\item{common.markers}{(optional) Logical. Default: \code{common.markers = TRUE},
will only keep markers in common (genotyped) between all the populations.}

\item{strata}{(optional/required) Required for VCF and haplotypes files,
optional for the other formats supported.

The strata file is a tab delimited file with a minimum of 2 columns headers:
\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}.
If a \code{strata} file is specified with all file formats that don't
require it, the strata argument will have precedence on the population
groupings used internally in those file formats.
The \code{STRATA} column can be any hierarchical grouping.
To create a strata file see \code{\link[radiator]{individuals2strata}}.
If you have already run
\href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/}{stacks} on your data,
the strata file is similar to a stacks \emph{population map file},
make sure you
have the required column names (\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}).
The strata column is cleaned of a white spaces that interfere with some
packages or codes: space is changed to an underscore \code{_}
Default: \code{strata = NULL}.}

\item{pop.levels}{(optional, string) This refers to the levels in a factor. In this
case, the id of the pop.
Use this argument to have the pop ordered your way instead of the default
alphabetical or numerical order. e.g. \code{pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")}
instead of the default \code{pop.levels = c("ALB", "ONT", "QUE")}.
White spaces in population names are replaced by underscore.
Default: \code{pop.levels = NULL}.}

\item{pop.labels}{(optional, string) Use this argument to rename/relabel
your pop or combine your pop. e.g. To combine \code{"QUE"} and \code{"ONT"}
into a new pop called \code{"NEW"}:
(1) First, define the levels for your pop with \code{pop.levels} argument:
\code{pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")}.
(2) then, use \code{pop.labels} argument:
\code{pop.levels = c("NEW", "NEW", "ALB")}.
To rename \code{"QUE"} to \code{"TAS"}:
\code{pop.labels = c("TAS", "ONT", "ALB")}.
Default: \code{pop.labels = NULL}. If you find this too complicated,
there is also the \code{strata} argument that can do the same thing,
see below.
White spaces in population names are replaced by underscore.}

\item{pop.select}{(string, optional) Selected list of populations for
the analysis. e.g. \code{pop.select = c("QUE", "ONT")} to select \code{QUE}
and \code{ONT} population samples (out of 20 pops).
Default: \code{pop.select = NULL}}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core used for parallel
execution during vcf import.
Default: \code{parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}
}
\value{
A list in the global environment with 6 objects:
\enumerate{
\item $snp.number.markers
\item $number.snp.reads.plot
\item $whitelist.markers
\item $tidy.filtered.snp.number
\item $blacklist.markers
\item $filters.parameters
}

The object can be isolated in separate object outside the list by
following the example below.
}
\description{
This filter removes outlier markers
with too many SNP number per locus/read.
The data requires snp and locus information (e.g. from a VCF file).
Having a higher than "normal" SNP number is usually the results of
assembly artifacts or bad assembly parameters.
This filter is population-agnostic, but still requires a strata
file if a vcf file is used as input.
}
\details{
\strong{Interactive version}

There are 2 steps in the interactive version to visualize and filter
the data based on the number of SNP on the read/locus:

Step 1. SNP number per read/locus visualization

Step 2. Choose the filtering thresholds
